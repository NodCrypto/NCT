# Welcome
Hello friend!
My pseudonym is NodCrypto.

Some may ask why did I take that name? and what does it have to do with Crypto:question:

I can say it right:exclamation:

I'm a cryptocurrency lover, some time ago I created a new Token called NodCrypto under the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chain like my name, it means NodCrypto (Node Crypto Token).
I want to make this Token one of the highlights in the payment and :currency_exchange:exchange system for certain small tasks:memo: (some may already be aware of such as Referrals, Followers, Airdrops and others). But for now I want to learn a programming language, to create a :robot:BOT that can be used on several social media/communities:family_man_man_girl_girl: such as Telegram/Discord.

**Maybe that's about the introduction and the new token.** :smile:

# What is next?
I use this website as a place to show some of my small assets (actually really small in the eyes of Crypto Lovers). I used to use Crypto for my snacks.

Oh yes:grey_exclamation:, I'm active on Telegram and Discord, maybe also Twitter (to find a giveaway, :rofl:).
